title: Setup Windows Containers in Azure

#Preparing Microsoft Azure for Windows Server Containers

Before creating and managing Windows Server Containers in Azure you will need to deploy a Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview image which has been pre-configured with the Windows Server Containers feature.
This guide will walk you through this process.

> Other getting started guides:
> 

*   Run Windows Server Containers in [a new Hyper-V virtual machine](./container_setup.md).
*   Run Windows Server Containers in [an existing virtual machine](./inplace_setup.md)
*   Setup Windows Server Containers [on a physical Windows Server Core installation](./inplace_setup.md)

##Start Using Azure Portal

If you have an Azure account, skip straight to [Create a Container Host VM](#CreateacontainerhostVM).

1.  Go to [azure.com](https://azure.com) and follow the steps for an [Azure Free Trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/).
2.  Sign in with your Microsoft account.
3.  When your account is ready to go, sign into the [Azure Management Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

##Create a Container Host VM

Click on the following link to start the VM creation process â€“ [New Windows Server Container Host in Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#gallery/Microsoft.WindowsServer2016TechnicalPreviewwithContainers).
