#Step 7: Export and import a virtual machine

You can quickly copy a virtual machine or move a virtual machine by using the export and import functionality.

##Export the VM

Exporting a virtual machine exports all of the pieces of the VM, including the checkpoints.

    *   Virtual Machines

2.  In the **Locate Folder** section, click Browse and navigate to C:\Users\Public\Windows Walkthrough VM  and then click **Next**.
3.  In the **Select virtual machine to import** screen click **Next**.
4.  In the **Choose Import Type** section, select **Register the virtual machine in place** and then click **Next**.
5.  In the **Choose Destination** section, leave the default and click **Next**.
6.  In Choose Storage folders, leave the default path and click **Next**.
7.  On the summary page you'll see a list of the paths where the new VM files will be located.
