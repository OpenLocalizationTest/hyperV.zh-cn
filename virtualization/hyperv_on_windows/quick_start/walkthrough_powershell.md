#Step 8: Experiment with Windows PowerShell

Now that you have walked through the basics of deploying Hyper-V, creating virtual machines and managing these virtual machines, let’s explore how you can automate many of these activities with PowerShell.

###Return a list of Hyper-V commands

1.  Click on the Windows start button, type **PowerShell**.
2.  Run the following command to display a searchable list of PowerShell commands available with the Hyper-V PowerShell Module.
    
    ```powershell
    get-command –module hyper-v | out-gridview


```
  You get something like this:

3. To learn more about a particular PowerShell command use `get-help`. For instance running the following command will return information about the `get-vm` Hyper-V command.

  ```powershell
get-help get-vm

```

 The output shows you how to structure the command, what the required and optional parameters are, and the aliases that you can use.

###Return a list of virtual machines

Use the `get-vm` command to return a list of virtual machines.

1.  In PowerShell, run the following command:
    
    `powershell
    get-vm
    `
    This displays something like this:
    
    !(media\get_vm.png)
2.  To return a list of only powered on virtual machines add a filter to the `get-vm` command.
    A filter can be added by using the where-object command.
    For more information on filtering see the [Using the Where-Object](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee177028.aspx) documentation.
    
    ```powershell
    get-vm | where {$_.State –eq ‘Running’}


 ```
3.  To list all virtual machines in a powered off state, run the following command. This command is a copy of the command from step 2 with the filter changed from ‘Running’ to ‘Off’.

 ```powershell
 get-vm | where {$_.State –eq ‘Off’}

 ```


###Start and shut down virtual machines

1.  To start a particular virtual machine, run the following command with name of the virtual machine:
    
    ```powershell
    Start-vm –Name virtual machine name


 ```

2. To start all currently powered off virtual machines, get a list of those machines and pipe the list to the 'start-vm' command:

  ```powershell
 get-vm | where {$_.State –eq ‘Off’} | start-vm

 ```

1.  To shut down all running virtual machines, run this:
    
    ```powershell
    get-vm | where {$_.State –eq ‘Running’} | stop-vm


 ```

### Create a VM checkpoint

To create a checkpoint using PowerShell, select the virtual machine using the `get-vm` command and pipe this to the `checkpoint-vm` command. Finally give the checkpoint a name using `-snapshotname`. The complete command will look like the following:

 ```powershell
 get-vm -Name VM Name | checkpoint-vm -snapshotname name for snapshot

 ```

For example, here is a checkpoint with the name DEMOCP:

###Create a new virtual machine

The following example shows how to create a new virtual machine in the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE).
This is a simple example and could be expanded on to include additional PowerShell features and more advanced VM deployments.

1.  To open the PowerShell ISE click on start, type **PowerShell ISE**.
2.  Run the following code to create a virtual machine.
    See the [New-VM](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848537.aspx) documentation for detailed information on the New-VM command.
    
    ```powershell
    $VMName = "VMNAME"
    
    $VM = @{
     Name = $VMName 
     MemoryStartupBytes = 2147483648
     Generation = 2
     NewVHDPath = "C:\Virtual Machines\$VMName\$VMName.vhdx"
     NewVHDSizeBytes = 53687091200
     BootDevice = "VHD"
     Path = "C:\Virtual Machines\$VMName "
     SwitchName = (get-vmswitch).Name[0]
    }
    
    New-VM @VM
    ```
