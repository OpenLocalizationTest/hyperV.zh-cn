Hyper-V lets you run more than one 32-bit or 64-bit x86 operating system at the same time on the same computer.
Instead of running directly on the computerâ€™s hardware, the operating systems run inside of a virtual machine (VM).

hello
Hyper-V in Windows is sometimes referred to as Client Hyper-V.

**Important:** You must license the software running on each of the guest virtual machines according to their operating system requirements.
