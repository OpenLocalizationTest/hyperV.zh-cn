#Supported Windows guests

This article lists the Windows operating systems supported as guests in Hyper-V on Windows, as well provides information about integration services.

> New Windows 10 runs as a guest operating system on Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V hosts.

##What does support mean?

Support means Microsoft has tested these host/guest combinations.
Issues with these combinations may receive attention from Product Support Services.

Microsoft provides support for guest operating systems in the following manner:

*   Issues found in Microsoft operating systems and in integration services are supported by Microsoft support.
*   For issues found in other operating systems that have been certified by the operating system vendor to run on Hyper-V, support is provided by the vendor.
*   For issues found in other operating systems, Microsoft submits the issue to the multi-vendor support community, [TSANet](http://www.tsanet.org/).

##What are integration services and why do they matter?

Hyper-V includes integration services for supported guest operating systems.
Integration services improve interaction between the host system and the virtual machine.

Some operating systems (including different versions of Windows) have the integration services built-in, while others provide integration services through Windows Update.
