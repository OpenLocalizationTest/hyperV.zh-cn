Disclaimer: This guide was written by Cynthia Nottingham and Sarah Cooley. Please let us know if you run into any issues or the steps aren't clear.




## Install Git ##
Install Git for Windows: [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win "http://git-scm.com/download/win")
- Gitbash is the command-line app that you will use to interact with your local Git repository
- Git GUI is an app used to create and clone Git repositories.
- Accept all default settings

Optional: To use GIT at a Powershell prompt, download this: [http://msysgit.github.io/](http://msysgit.github.io/ "http://msysgit.github.io/") and to use Git from VS, install the VS extensions: [https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8f594baa-e44e-4114-8381-e175ace0fe97](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8f594baa-e44e-4114-8381-e175ace0fe97 "https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/8f594baa-e44e-4114-8381-e175ace0fe97")

## Enable Alternate Credentials ##
1. Go to the repository in VS Online: [https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV#path=%2F&version=GBmaster&_a=contents](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV#path=%2F&version=GBmaster&_a=contents "https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV#path=%2F&version=GBmaster&_a=contents")
2. On the upper right, click your name and then click **My profile**.  
3. In your profile details, click **Credentials**.
4. Check that the e-mail address is correct and then put in the password for your account and click **Save Changes**.

When you use GitBash you will occasionally be asked to enter your username and password. The information that you just entered for your alternate credentials will be what you have to enter in GitBash. When you type your password in GitBash, you don't get asterisks or any other indication that you are typing.

## Clone the Repository ##

1. Back in VS Online, on the right part of the page, click **Clone** and copy the address for cloning into your clipboard. Is should be: https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV
2. Open GitBash
type **cd *path*** where *path* is where you want the files to be stored. For example: **cd c:\GIT**
3. Then type: **git clone https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV**
4. Type: **cd hyperv**. This puts you in the master branch.
5. Leave GitBash open for now. We will come back to it later.


## Write something ##
There are lots of options for creating markdown. You just need a text editor like:
- Good 'ol Notepad - already installed and bare bones beautiful.
- Notepad++: [http://notepad-plus-plus.org/](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/ "http://notepad-plus-plus.org/")
- MarkdownPad: [http://www.markdownpad.com/](http://www.markdownpad.com/ "http://www.markdownpad.com/")

1. For now, just open notepad and copy\paste the following into a file:
"# Hello World #"
2. Save the file into the folder you are using for the master repository as *alias*.md. For example: **C:\git\hyperv\cynthn.md**

## Add your file to Git ##

1. Go back to GitBash and type: **git add *alias*.md**. For example: **git add cynthn.md**. This adds or updates your files in the local "index". This is how Git tracks your files. FYI: Tab complete works in GitBash, so you can start typing the name of the file and hit **Tab** to have it auto-complete the file name.
2. Type: **git commit -am "Testing adding my files to master"**. This is how you tell Git that you have made a change to a file and prepare it for being pushed back to the master shared repository (origin). The information in quotes is used as a check-in remark.
3. Type: **git push**. This pushes your changes to the master copy in the shared repository (origin).
4. Go back to VS online and see if your files is listed there now: [https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV#path=%2F&version=GBmaster&_a=contents](https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV#path=%2F&version=GBmaster&_a=contents "https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/Documentation/_git/HyperV#path=%2F&version=GBmaster&_a=contents"). You should see your new file and the comment that you put in when yo did the commit.

## Get all the new stuff from the master repository (origin) ##

Type: **git pull**

Pull often! If you do a push and haven't done a pull in awhile, you may have to deal with merge conflicts if someone else has also been working on that file.

## Send your local changes to the master shared repository (origin) ##
You have to do all three steps before your files are available for everyone else to pull:

1. **git add** ***.md** to add all your files or do **git add *filename*.md** to just add one file
2. **git commit -am "My reasoning for sharing these changes"**
3. **git push**


## Required metadata ##
At the top of each file, there is some required metadata:
`ms.ContentId: <GUID>
title: <topic title>`

- Each topic needs a unique GUID which you can get in Visual Studio by clicking on **Tools** and selecting **Create GUID** (the registry one has the least extra stuff, just delete the brackets)
- The topic is just what it seems like, the official formal title for the topic

## Local Preview ##
This is a work in progress: [local_preview](local_preview.md)

# Warning - inserting images in MarkdownPad #
 **Do Not let MarkdownPad upload your images!!!** When you add an image in MarkdownPad, there is a button to **Browse and Upload** which actually uploads the image to imgur.com - which is really bad if it is super secret stuff.


## Markdown - special characters ##
Markdown validation trips over special characters like alligators (<>) and quotes ("). Where you need to use special characters (file paths etc) you can mark the text as “code” in MarkdownPad or surround it with “back ticks” which are specific single quotes - **`** - this is the mark that is probably on the same key as **~** . 

You have to use 3 whacks to get 2 to show – so to get a path like `\\myfile` to show correctly, you need to use `\\\myfile` in markdown.

## If you are having permissions issues ## 
If you are using git.exe on Windows…
1.     Run the following command elevated \\gitdrops\ProjectJ\drops\git-remote-no-proxy\install.cmd
2.     Run the following command on your Git repo git config --global url.mshttps://microsoft.visualstudio.com/.insteadof https://microsoft.visualstudio.com/

## MarkdownPad - Live Preview##
If you have troubles with Live Preview in MarkdownPad (it displays an error message stating: **This view has crashed!** and no HTML is displayed).

To fix this issue, please try installing the [Awesomium 1.6.6 SDK](http://markdownpad.com/download/awesomium_v1.6.6_sdk_win.exe).

If you continue to experience issues, please install [Microsoft's DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109).
